# <img src="src/docs/flea-framework.png" width="80" height="80"> Flea Framework
Flea Framework, named Flea, which originates from the flea market graduation project of the author Huazie, and the first version of the code comes from it. In addition, when we mention fleas, we naturally think of their small size and ubiquitous characteristics. This is also the goal that the Flea Framework has been working hard to become a small and easy-to-use Java application basic development framework.
